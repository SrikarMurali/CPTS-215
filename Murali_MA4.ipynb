    "You can make a queue using these function by using the push and pop function for the enqueue and dequeue methods. To do this you must first implement the queue as a list, and then when adding items to the queue just push them in at the front. When trying to dequeue items, just traverse the list with a loop until you get to the oldest item in the queue. You could use two stacks for this. To enqueue you should follow these steps. While stack1 is not empty, push everything from satck1 to stack2. Push x to stack1 (assuming size of stacks is unlimited). Push everything back to stack1. To dequeue follow these steps. If stack1 is empty then error. If not then pop an item from stack1 and return it.\n",

    "Overall the linked list implementation of the queue is the fastest for the dequeue method. After this comes the list implementation and finally the two stacks implementation. The difference between these implementations is rather drastic. The two stacks implementation was too slow for this computer to handle for lists of size 10000. The list implementation was fine with a list size of 10000, but was too slow for the words.txt file. However the linked list implementation was extremely fast in all cases, even when the words.txt file was used. Thus, the linked list implementation of the queue should be used whenever possible as its dequeue function is extremely fast."
